Goal is to make a simple sticky note app in react where you can save sticky notes and then convert it into a txt file where it makes a bullet list using header as the main bullet and then the discription to be the semi bullet as well as making the sticky note a savable file type to load up when you want

Honestly is done for all intensive purposes was mostly a small tool I made for myself for note taking has helped me when taking notes
not a lot of high level functionality just the ability to make a sticky note write on the note and move the note and save your notes to a text file
